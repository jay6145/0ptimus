##  Demo Script (For Judges)

### Step 0: Peak Hours Dashboard (NEW - SHOW THIS FIRST!) 
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/peak-hours` (or click " Peak Hours" button)
2. **Current Time & Next Peak** shows:
   - Current time with countdown to next rush period
   - "Next peak: Lunch rush in 2h 15m" (or "LUNCH RUSH IN PROGRESS")
3. **Critical Alerts** banner:
   - "2 Items Will Stock Out During Peak Hours"
   - Shows which items and exact stockout times during rush
4. **Today's Prep Schedule**:
   - "Prep 40 units Chicken by 10:30 AM" (CRITICAL - for lunch rush)
   - "Prep 15 units Guacamole by 4:45 PM" (HIGH - for dinner rush)
   - Each task shows quantity, timing, and urgency
5. **Hourly Forecast Charts**:
   - Visual bar charts showing demand by hour
   - Orange bars = peak hours (11am-2pm, 5pm-8pm)
   - Red bars = predicted stockout during that hour
   - Regular blue = normal demand

**Key Insight:** "System predicts chicken will run out at 12:45 PM during lunch rush - gives 2+ hours advance warning to prep!"

---

### Step 1: Overview Dashboard
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Top Alerts Bar** shows:
   - "5 SKUs at risk of stockout in next 3 days"
   - "3 stores with low inventory confidence (<70)"
   - "8 transfer opportunities available"
3. **IoT Telemetry Card** 🌡️ (NEW - show this to judges):
   - Shows live sensor data: "Cooler Temp: 38.1°F" (updated 8s ago)
   - **Real IoT sensor** (calibrated for demo - room temp sensor adjusted by -20°C offset)

5. **Sort** by "Days of Cover" to see most urgent stockouts

**Key Insight:** "Coca-Cola 12pk at Atlanta Store has only 1.9 days of inventory left"

---

### Step 2: SKU Detail Analysis
1. Click on "Coca-Cola 12pk" at Atlanta Store
2. **Forecast Chart** shows:
   - Declining on-hand inventory
   - Higher sales on weekends (pattern detection)
   - Predicted stockout date: Feb 9, 2026
3. **Click " View Hourly Forecast (Peak Hours)"** button:
   - Shows hourly demand breakdown
   - Highlights peak hours in orange
   - Shows exact hour of stockout (e.g., "Will run out at 1:00 PM")
   - Red bars indicate when inventory hits zero
4. **Anomaly Timeline** shows:
   - Flagged event 3 days ago
   - **Explanation**: "Expected +20 units after receiving shipment, but inventory only increased by 12 units. Possible receiving error or damage."
5. **Recommendation Cards**:
   - **Transfer**: "Transfer 25 units from Boston Store (prevents stockout, saves $455)"
   - **Reorder**: "If transfer not feasible, order 84 units from supplier (3-day lead time)"
   - **Cycle Count**: "Schedule physical count (last count: 18 days ago)"

**Key Insight:** "System detected a receiving discrepancy automatically and suggests transfer over new PO"

---

### Step 3: Create Transfer
1. Navigate to "Transfers" page
2. **Recommendations Tab** shows 8 suggested transfers
3. Click on "Coca-Cola 12pk: Boston → Atlanta"
4. **Transfer Details**:
   - From: Boston Store (45 units, 15 days cover)
   - To: Atlanta Store (15 units, 1.9 days cover)
   - Quantity: 25 units
   - Distance: 1,080 km
   - Cost: $45 (vs $500 for new PO)
   - **Rationale**: "Receiver will stock out in 1.9 days. Donor has 11 excess days of cover. Transfer prevents stockout and reduces donor's overstock."
5. Click "Create Draft Transfer"
6. Transfer moves to "Drafts" tab
7. Click "Approve" → Status updates to "Approved"

**Key Insight:** "Transfer saves $455 and prevents stockout 2 days faster than new order"

---

### Step 4: Anomaly Investigation
1. Navigate back to Overview
2. Filter by "Low Confidence (<70)"
3. Click on "Premium Steak" at Denver Store
4. **Confidence Score**: 45% (critical)
5. **Anomaly Pattern**: 5 of last 7 days show negative residuals
6. **Explanation**: "Systematic shrink pattern detected. Possible theft or unrecorded waste."
7. **Recommendation**: "Immediate investigation required. Schedule cycle count and review security footage."

**Key Insight:** "System detects systematic shrink patterns that would be missed by manual review"

---

### Step 5: Data Regeneration
1. Navigate to "Admin" page
2. **Database Stats** shows current data
3. Click "Regenerate Demo Data"
4. New data generated with fresh anomalies and scenarios
5. Return to Overview to see new alerts

**Key Insight:** "Demo can be reset instantly for multiple presentations"

##  Core Algorithms

### Demand Forecasting
```python
# Weighted moving average with day-of-week patterns
weekday_avg = weighted_average(weekday_sales, decay=0.95)
weekend_avg = weighted_average(weekend_sales, decay=0.95)
daily_demand = weekday_avg if is_weekday else weekend_avg
days_of_cover = on_hand / max(daily_demand, 0.1)
```

### Anomaly Detection
```python
# Residual-based detection
expected_delta = receipts - sales + transfers_in - transfers_out
actual_delta = on_hand_today - on_hand_yesterday
residual = actual_delta - expected_delta

if residual < threshold:
    flag_anomaly(severity, explanation)
```

### Confidence Scoring
```python
# Start at 100, deduct for risk factors
score = 100
score -= anomaly_frequency * 5  # Max -30
score -= anomaly_magnitude * 0.5  # Max -20
score -= days_since_count * 0.3  # Max -20
score -= perishable_penalty  # -10 if applicable
score -= systematic_shrink_penalty  # -15 if pattern detected
```

### Transfer Optimization
```python
# Distance-weighted greedy matching
for receiver in sorted_by_urgency(receivers):
    best_donor = max(donors, key=lambda d: 
        d.surplus / (1 + distance_penalty(d, receiver))
    )
    recommend_transfer(best_donor, receiver, qty)
```

##  Troubleshooting

### Docker containers won't start
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
```

### Frontend can't connect to backend
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `frontend/.env.local`
- Verify backend: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/health`
- Check CORS settings in `backend/app/main.py`

### No demo data visible
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/demo/regenerate
```

### Slow performance
- Reduce demo data size (50 SKUs instead of 200)
- Check database indexes
- Enable query logging
